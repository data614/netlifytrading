# Final Code Review & Security Audit

## Scope
- Quant Screener rendering pipeline
- Shared HTML sanitization utilities
- Persistent preference storage flows

## Findings

### 1. Output Encoding for Screener Rows (Resolved)
- **Risk**: Untrusted AI Analyst payloads were written into the DOM with `innerHTML`, enabling XSS vectors if upstream data were compromised.
- **Resolution**: Introduced a centralized HTML sanitizer that strips control characters, escapes HTML-significant glyphs, and enforces safe attribute truncation. The screener now encodes every dynamic field prior to DOM insertion, eliminating direct HTML injection pathways while keeping the UI contract intact. 【F:utils/html-sanitizer.js†L1-L36】【F:quant-screener.js†L115-L164】
- **Residual Risk**: Low. Additional UI surfaces using `innerHTML` should adopt the same utility.

### 2. Preference Persistence Hardening (Existing Strength)
- The storage layer already guards against corrupt JSON, coercing values to safe defaults while logging recoverable faults. This behavior was verified during the audit and remains robust. 【F:utils/persistent-screen-preferences.js†L120-L168】

### 3. Test Coverage & Tooling
- Added deterministic unit coverage for the new sanitizer utilities, ensuring encoding regressions are caught automatically. 【F:tests/utils/htmlSanitizer.spec.js†L1-L23】
- Restored the jsdom test environment to guarantee parity with browser behavior. (Recorded in run logs.)

## Recommendations
1. Roll out the sanitizer helper across remaining modules that render external data (e.g., news feeds) to enforce defense-in-depth.
2. Monitor npm audit output (1 high severity advisory) and evaluate dependency upgrades in a dedicated hardening sprint.
3. Incorporate automated static analysis (ESLint security plugins) into CI to surface similar issues earlier.

## Sign-off
All scoped risks have been mitigated or documented with follow-up actions. The codebase is ready for integration.
